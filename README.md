# Predicting the Stock Market

We'll be using historical data on the price of the S&P500 Index to make predictions about future prices. Predicting whether an index goes up or down helps forecast how the stock market as a whole performs. Since stocks tend to correlate with how well the economy as a whole is performs, it can also help with economic forecasts.

This is a simple simulation of using linear regression models in ML.
